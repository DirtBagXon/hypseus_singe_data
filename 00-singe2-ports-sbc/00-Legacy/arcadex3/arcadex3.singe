	YOU CAN EDIT THIS FILE TO CREATE YOUR OWN GAME IN A FEW HOURS! 

	If you want to create your own Laserdisc game using SINGE, you just need to have some videos and then to edit this file. 
	It's really easy, most of the work is already done. Just read my comments. The file is quite long but you probably 
	don't need to fill everything.

-- Other moves : RUN (Stick L/R), RUNMAX, RUNMIN, MASH 2 (2 buttons), MASH2MAX, MASH2MIN, SKIP (skip some narrative frames), PATHUD (choose between UP and DOWN), PATHLR.

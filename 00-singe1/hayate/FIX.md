New version of 'hayate' bytecode: v1.15

    This will allow you continue the game when the death loop bug is triggered.
    Lives will decrease as normal and a generic death/respawn scene will be used
    after the work-a-round is applied.  The game is now completable.

If the bug is detected it will log, and report:

`Death loop bug triggered - death scenes will be disabled`
